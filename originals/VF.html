Part 1: Experiences in a Concentration Camp
</part>
<p>
This book does not claim to be an account of facts and events
but of personal experiences, experiences which millions of
prisoners have suffered time and again. It is the inside
story of a concentration camp, told by one of its survivors.
This tale is not concerned with the great horrors, which
have already been described often enough (though less
often believed), but with the multitude of small torments.
In other words, it will try to answer this question: How
was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the
mind of the average prisoner?
</p>
<p>
Most of the events described here did not take place in
the large and famous camps, but in the small ones where
most of the real extermination took place. This story is not
about the suffering and death of great heroes and martyrs,
nor is it about the prominent Capos — prisoners who acted
as trustees, having special privileges — or well-known prisoners. Thus it is not so much concerned with the sufferings
of the mighty, but with the sacrifices, the crucifixion and
the deaths of the great army of unknown and unrecorded
victims. It was these common prisoners, who bore no distinguishing marks on their sleeves, whom the Capos really
despised. While these ordinary prisoners had little or nothing to eat, the Capos were never hungry; in fact many of
the Capos fared better in the camp than they had in their
entire lives. Often they were harder on the prisoners than
were the guards, and beat them more cruelly than the SS
men did. These Capos, of course, were chosen only from
those prisoners whose characters promised to make them
suitable for such procedures, and if they did not comply
with what was expected of them, they were immediately
demoted. They soon became much like the SS men and the
camp wardens and may be judged on a similar psychological basis.

It is easy for the outsider to get the wrong conception of
camp life, a conception mingled with sentiment and pity.
Little does he know of the hard fight for existence which
raged among the prisoners. This was an unrelenting struggle for daily bread and for life itself, for one’s own sake or
for that of a good friend.
</p>
<p>
Let us take the case of a transport which was officially
announced to transfer a certain number of prisoners to another camp; but it was a fairly safe guess that its final
destination would be the gas chambers. A selection of sick
or feeble prisoners incapable of work would be sent to one
of the big central camps which were fitted with gas
chambers and crematoriums. The selection process was the
signal for a free fight among all the prisoners, or of group
against group. All that mattered was that one’s own name
and that of one’s friend were crossed off the list of victims,
though everyone knew that for each man saved another
victim had to be found.
</p>
<p>
A definite number of prisoners had to go with each
transport. It did not really matter which, since each of them
was nothing but a number. On their admission to the camp
(at least this was the method in Auschwitz) all their documents had been taken from them, together with their other
possessions. Each prisoner, therefore, had had an opportunity to claim a fictitious name or profession; and for various reasons many did this. The authorities were interested
only in the captives’ numbers. These numbers were often
tattooed on their skin, and also had to be sewn to a certain
spot on the trousers, jacket, or coat. Any guard who wanted
to make a charge against a prisoner just glanced at his
number (and how we dreaded such glances!); he never
asked for his name.
