<p>
The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
</p>
<p>
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
</p>
<p>
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
</p>
<p>
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
</p>
<p>
.
</p>
<p>
Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
</p>
<p>
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
</p>
<p>
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
</p>
<p>
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.
</p>
<p>
.
</p>
<p>
For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
</p>
<p>
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
</p>
<p>
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
</p>
<p>
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!
</p>
<p>
.
</p>
<p>
And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
</p>
<p>
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
</p>
<p>
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
</p>
<p>
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.
</p>
<p>
.
</p>
<p>
And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
</p>
<p>
With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
</p>
<p>
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
</p>
<p>
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.
</p>
<p>
.
</p>
<p>
And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,
</p>
<p>
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
</p>
<p>
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
</p>
<p>
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!
</p>
