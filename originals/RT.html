</book>
<p>
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
</p>
<p>
Where knowledge is free;
</p>
<p>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
</p>
<p>
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
</p>
<p>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
</p>
<p>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
</p>
<p>
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
